# Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 Introduction

- The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3) is a computing module based on the Raspberry Pi 3, designed to offer greater flexibility and scalability. It uses the same processor and memory as the Raspberry Pi 3, but features a smaller form factor and enhanced computing performance.

## Key Features

- **Processor and Memory**:  
  The CM3 is equipped with the same 1.2 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor and 1 GB LPDDR2 memory as the Raspberry Pi 3, enabling it to handle complex computations and multitasking efficiently.

- **Computational Power**:  
  The processor in the CM3 delivers higher computational performance, making it suitable for projects that demand significant processing power, such as data analysis, machine learning, and embedded computing.

- **Size and Connectivity**:  
  With its compact size, the CM3 is ideal for embedded and custom projects. It offers a variety of connectivity options, including standard GPIO pins, USB, HDMI, and more.

- **Computing Module Design**:  
  The design of the CM3 is intended for use cases that require highly customized hardware integration, allowing developers to embed and integrate it onto their own custom baseboards.

## Application Areas

- **Industrial Automation**:  
  The CM3 is well-suited for industrial automation, where it can be used for monitoring, control, and data collection tasks.

- **Embedded Systems**:  
  Due to its compact size and robust computing power, the CM3 is an ideal choice for developing embedded systems such as machine control, robotics, and other embedded computing devices.

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**:  
  The CM3 can be used to develop IoT-connected devices, including sensors, smart home gadgets, and monitoring systems.

## Usage and Development

Developers can leverage the official documentation and tools provided by Raspberry Pi to develop and program the CM3. The module supports multiple operating systems, including Raspbian (the Debian-based operating system for Raspberry Pi) and other custom OS options.

## Summary

The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3) is a powerful computing module that encapsulates a high-performance processor and memory in a compact form factor, making it suitable for a wide range of embedded computing and custom projects.
